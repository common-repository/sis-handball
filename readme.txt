== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use additional parameters (additional_params)? =

Additional parameters allow you to add some extra functionality to only one shortcode. Note the exact syntax of this option, otherwise it can cause errors!

`[sishandball type="xxx" league="xxx" additional_params="foo:'bar'|foo:'bar'|foo:'bar'"]`

**class**
This can contain any string as an extra class for the table output.
	
**table_head**
Only option available is **hidden**, if it is set, the table head will not be shown.

**cache**
Only option available is **no-cache**, if it is set, the shortcode data will not be cached.
This option only makes sense if the global caching option is set, otherwise it will have no impact!

**ignore-team-replacement**
Only option available is **1**, if it is set, the shortcode will ignore possible global team name replacements

**ignore-lazy-loading**
Only option available is **1**, if it is set, the shortcode will ignore lazy loading and will only display the results defined by the limit parameter.
This option only makes sense if global lazy loading is activated, otherwise it will have no impact!
